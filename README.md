# Pumpr: A Dating App for Fitness Enthusiasts

## Description

Dating can tough, and it can often be just as difficult to meet people who share a passion for fitness. With this app, Pumpr, our goal is to combine fitness and flirting. Pumpr connects users with their gym crushes or helps them find platonic gym partners to share a work out with.

In its current state, Pumpr allows users to create a profile and search for other users by email. It also features a map displaying the user's location, though this will eventually be used to filter search results by area. We are excited to further develop Pumpr and bring gains to hearts and muscles across the world

### Future Development 

* Allow users to browse other user profiles
* Allow users to filter user results with user interests
* Add music player to each profile
* Integrate map into search
* Allow users to upload photos and videos
* Add a messaging feature
* Allow users to customize certain profile questions 

## Tasks
